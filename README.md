# AudioPuppets

Audio Puppets is a browser based javascript project. The aim is to create 2D animated characters that react to a users mic, simply moving their mouths when the user speaks. I'm not trying for anything super complex here. The main goal is just to create a sound light of sorts that instead of chaning a lights color it changings the puppet src file from not talking to talking and back. I'll admit that I don't 100% know what I'm doing. This is my first Javascript project beyond basic onClick commands. And so far has prooved trickier than I had originally expected, mainly due to browser security restrictions...

Audio Puppets was started and is owned by ArtistEvan (aka Evan Harris) 2020
